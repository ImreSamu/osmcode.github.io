[Osmium](https://osmcode.org/osmium) is a versatile command line tool for
working with OpenStreetMap data. It includes many useful functions for
manipulating OSM data and often outperforms similar tools. This manual will
introduce the tool, give a general overview and describe some use cases. For
the nitty gritty detail consult the [manual
pages](https://docs.osmcode.org/osmium/latest/).

Osmium is Open Source and available under the GNU General Public License.
It works and is regularly tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Osmium is based on the C++ library [libosmium](https://osmcode.org/libosmium)
and it gets most of its functionality from it. If the command line tool doesn't
do something you need, have a look at the library. Maybe you can use it to
create a program that does what you want.
