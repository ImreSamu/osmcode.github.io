title: Command line completion
---

There is a command line completion configuration available for Zsh users. This
allows comfortable command line completion of all Osmium commands including
command line options. If you have installed Osmium as a Debian package, it
will be installed for you. If you built and installed from sources, you need
to install the file `zsh_completion/_osmium` yourself, for instance in
`/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/`.
