title: The Osmium command
---

The starting point for everything is the `osmium` command. All the
functionality of Osmium is available via this one command and its
"subcommands", similar to how the `git` command works for instance. Just
calling

    osmium

will give you a list of subcommands. Use

    osmium COMMAND -h

to get a short description about a subcommand's options. Use

    osmium help COMMAND

to display the manual page explaining all the details. If Osmium is installed
correctly on your system, you can also get those manpages using the usual `man`
command:

    man osmium
    man osmium-fileinfo

etc.

The manpages are also available [on the web](http://docs.osmcode.org/osmium/latest/).
