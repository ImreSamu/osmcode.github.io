*"Simple things should be simple and complex things should be possible."* - Alan Kay

The Osmium Concepts Manual explains some high level concepts of Osmium and all the things that are the same whether you use the libosmium C++ library, its NodeJS or Python bindings, or an application based on any of these. Read this first before you dive into the details of how to use the libraries.

This manual introduces some concepts that users of the
[Libosmium](http://osmcode.org/libosmium/) C++ library, the
[PyOsmium](http://osmcode.org/pyosmium/) Python bindings and the
[node-osmium](http://osmcode.org/node-osmium/) Node.JS bindings of this library
need to understand to work effectively.

While this manual was written for the users of those libraries it can also be
helpful for users of the [Osmium command line tool](http://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/)
and many other OSM tools, because it contains lots of general information about
the OpenStreetMap data model.
