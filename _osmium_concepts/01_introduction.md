*"Simple things should be simple and complex things should be possible."* - Alan Kay

This manual introduces some high level concepts that users of the
[Libosmium](https://osmcode.org/libosmium/) C++ library, the
[PyOsmium](https://osmcode.org/pyosmium/) Python bindings and the
[node-osmium](https://osmcode.org/node-osmium/) Node.JS bindings of this library
need to understand to work effectively. Read this first before you dive into
the details of how to use the libraries.

While this manual was written for the users of those libraries it can also be
helpful for users of the [Osmium command line tool](https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/)
and many other OSM tools, because it contains lots of general information about
the OpenStreetMap data model.
