    <p>A fast and flexible C++ library for working with OpenStreetMap data</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>The Osmium Library has extensive support for all types of OSM entities:
nodes, ways, relations, and changesets. It allows reading from and writing to
OSM files in XML and PBF formats, including change files and full history
files. Osmium can store OSM data in memory and on disk in various formats and
using various indexes. Its easy to use <i>handler</i> interface allows you to
quickly write data filtering and conversion functions. Osmium can create WKT,
WKB, OGR, GEOS and GeoJSON geometries for easy conversion into many GIS
formats and it can assemble multipolygons from ways and relations.</p>
