<h2 id="name">NAME</h2>
<p>osmium-fileinfo - Show information about an OpenStreetMap file.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p><strong>osmium fileinfo</strong> [OPTIONS] <em>FILE</em></p>
<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Shows various information about OSM files such as the file type, bounding boxes in the header, etc.</p>
<p>This command will usually only read the file header. Use the <strong>--extended</strong> option to show more information.</p>
<p>The output is split into three sections:</p>
<dl>
<dt>File</dt>
<dd><p>This section shows the information available without opening the file itself. It contains the file name, the format deduced from the file name, the compression used and the size of the file in bytes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Header</dt>
<dd><p>This section shows the information available from the header of the file (if available, OPL files have no header). Any available bounding boxes are shown as well as header options such as the generator and file format version.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Data</dt>
<dd><p>This section shows the information available from reading the whole file. It is only shown if the <strong>--extended</strong> option was used. It shows the actual bounding box calculated from the nodes in the file, the first and last timestamp of all objects in the file, a SHA1 checksum of the data in the file and the number of changesets, nodes, ways, and relations found in the file.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>--extended, -e</dt>
<dd><p>Read the complete file and show additional information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>--input-format, -f</dt>
<dd><p>The format of the input file. Can be used to set the input file format if it can't be autodetected from the file name. See <strong>osmium-file-formats</strong>(5) or the libosmium manual for details.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="diagnostics">DIAGNOSTICS</h2>
<p><strong>osmium fileinfo</strong> exits with code 0 if everything went alright, it exits with code 2 if there was a problem with the command line arguments, and with exit code 1 if some other error occurred.</p>
