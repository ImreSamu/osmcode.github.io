<h2>Programs</h2>

<p>In the <i>osmium-contrib</i> repository we collect little programs that use
the Osmium Library in various ways. These programs can be useful in their own
right, but they also provide nice examples for developers who want to learn
about the features of the Osmium Library.</p>

<p>Currently the following programs are available:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-contrib/tree/master/amenity_list">amenity_list</a> - Print list of amenities in OSM file</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-contrib/tree/master/export_to_wkt">export_to_wkt</a> - Write out node, way, and area geometries as WKT</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-contrib/tree/master/mapolution">mapolution</a> - Show evolution of OSM map</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-contrib/tree/master/node_density">node_density</a> - Create image showing OSM node density</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-contrib/tree/master/pub_names">pub_names</a> - Extract names of pubs from OSM file</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-contrib/tree/master/road_length">road_length</a> - Calculate length of highways from an OSM file</li>
