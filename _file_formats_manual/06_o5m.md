chapter: 6
title: O5M/O5C Format
---

The [o5m and o5c formats](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/O5m) were
invented and are mainly used by the
[osmconvert](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert),
[osmfilter](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter), and
[osmupdate](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmupdate) tools. The two
versions are for data files (.o5m) and change files (.o5c). History files
are not supported.

Osmium can read those files to be compatible with other tools, but it can't
write the file format.

O5M/O5C files are larger than PBF files (unless you compress them again, which
is possible, but makes them slower to read and write of course).
